## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS and Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- API fetch

### What I learned

I strengthened my knowledge of both HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript, learning a little more about applying some attributes and how they work on the website being developed.

### Continued development

I would like to work with the CSS framework tailwind with which I have not worked much but I find it interesting, for this challenge I planned to make use of some framework such as Reactjs, tailwind but I preferred to test my skills with HTML, Bootstrao and JavaScript.
